The code for my implementation of the Decaf compiler.

Contains code for:
- Lexer; defining the tokens.
- Parser; parsing the tokens from given source code, validates grammatical structure.
- Semantic Checking; to validate the tokens to ensure that they comply with the semantic rules.
- Code Generation; generates low level IR of the source code that is closer to assembly language.
